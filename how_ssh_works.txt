The directive below in /etc/ssh/sshd_config dictates if password authentication will be allowed for logging in to any user via ssh 
#PasswordAuthentication yes

For passwordless authentication to work (i.e via keys) the  public key from the localuser ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub must be copied to the remote users .ssh/authorizedkeys file

A public-private key pair can be generated using ssh-keygen
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub is the public key
~/.ssh/id_rsa is the private key
The public key can be copied using ssh-copy-id command, after which you will be prompted for the remote user's login password(which means #PasswordAuthentication yes must be enabled)
